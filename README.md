## Deep learning MOOC in french 

I made summaries in french of the lessons of the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization (Andrew Ng MOOC): https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning
This includes :
- Course 1 : 
	- what are Neural Networks, what are their applications and different types of Deep Neural Networks
	- Logistic regression is a very small Neural Networks, vectorization and gradient descent to estimate parameters of the model
	- Activation functions for Neural Networks : relu, tanh, sigmoid. Shallow Neural Networks.
          Back propagation algorithm formalism with vectorization
	- Deep Neural Networks with L layers : backward propagation algorithm with vectorization, matrix forms. 
  
- Other courses summaries are in construction for :
  - Improving Deep Neural Networks
  - Structuring Machine Learning Projects
  - Convolutional Neural Networks
  - Sequence Models 

Michael Nielsen proposes in "How the backpropagation algorithm works"
on its website : http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html, the presentation of the Backprop algorithm.
In this repository, my personal notes about the equations of backprop of Michael Nielsen
are available in "compl√©ments_cours_1_semaine_4". I present also some proofs about the equations of backprop of Andrew Ng
but these are also my personal notes.
